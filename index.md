  TO THE KING.  
  
  
  SIRE,  
  
  
  IF in acknowledging those acts of

condescension and patronage, your Majesty
has showered upon me I be thought vain—
I must glory in the accusation; for though
the proper forms and gradations of society
have placed me at that humble distance to
preclude a declaration of that respect and
regard I owe my King, (except in silent thought
and action) can I be blamed if on such an
occasion as the present, my nature seeks
with an eagerness (liable to the charge of
presumption) to unbosom all its feelings ?


Permit me then, gracious Sir, to say in
the true style of an Englishman  
  
  
  I thank you,  
  
  
  a2
<!-- Leaf 10, Page: IV -->
nor can the simplicity of my offering deduct
from its sincerity.


The oak (the monarch of the wood) shades
the common herbage, yet shall not the grass
be despised, though lightly it covers the
mould that nourishes its roots.—A feeble

aid is what the hand of Providence allows,
and offering that, it gives—its all.  
  
  
  The Drama I have the honour ofsubmitting to your Majesty has little claim to
your attention, excepting that its leading
feature is patriotic ardour. At no time was
this principle better understood, or more
properly appreciated, than at the present
moment.—I wish not however to hope the
sentiments I have connected with the original
piece can aid the general cause—no, when
honour and justice bid them to the field,
Britons need no spur, resolved they go
bravely to conquer or to die. Here I pause—
but may that Supreme Power, " whosedis7
<!-- Leaf 11, Page: V -->
pensations, though inscrutable, are ever just,"
view this isle with mercy and protection,
that your august Family may reign over the
united kingdoms crowned with peace, plenty,
and happiness, when the present race shall
repose from worldly care, and all mortal
vicissitudes.  
  
  
  With this heartfelt prayer, may it please  
  
  
  YOUR MAJESTY

To accept the unfeigned respect and affection
Of your dutiful  
  
  
  And obedient subject,

  PROLOGUE.  
  
  
  By Mr. HOLT.  
  
  
  (As spoken on the first night of performance, the Author's  
  
  
  Benefit.)


SUBE, of all fates the Poet's is most hard,
A certain labour, and no sure reward,
All other trades this constant rule pursue,
The work once done, the workman has his due;
Whate'er the event, still none unpaid we see,
But kill or cure the Doctor has his fee.

Nor is the Lawyer's barren labour lost,
His suit he loses, but he gains his cost:
Not so the Bard—'tis fate's peculiar spite,
That here 'tis only /ia//"his work to write.
His five acts done, a harder task remains,
To phase you all, or else to lose his pains—
To please you all! Heaven help us to the feast,
To suit so numerous, or so strange a guest,
Will the same dish feed this and yonder rows.
Or Critics please, what suits the taste of Beaux ?
Tis said that Greece of old a monster bore,
A beast, a horse behind, a man before,—
They call'd it Centaur, or a name as strange,
The like was never seen in yonder change.—
This beast some travellers say was lately caught.
And to our tower might ere this been brought,
But that the keepers could not fix a plan,
To feed a beast, at once both horse and man—
<!-- Leaf 13, Page: VII -->
They gave it bread, that wouldn't suit the horse,
And oats and hay agreed with man still worse;—
In short their wit could hit on nothing right,
The Centaur lost his life, and you a sight. 
But stay,—in yonder Critic's brow I read, "^
Are We this Centaur?,—Yes, you are indeed, >
A thing as various and as hard to feed. J
Will grandams chuckle, where Miss Biddy smiles,
And law and army class in rank and files—
Whilst yon spruce gentleman lisps out " bravo;"
What shouts of " off, off, off," from yonder
rowThat this confusion oft has marr'd the scene,
Declare ye ghosts of plays that once have been.—
This for our Author,—now for one whose breast
With liveliest sense of gratitude imprest,

Warm for past favours, yet more warm for new,
Pants to burst forth in gratitude to you—
As some rough hind on Essex's barren strand,
With winter drudgery works th' unwilling landj
His fruits now nurtur'd by the vernal rains,
Forgets his labours, as he sees his gains.

So with the anxious actor of to-night,
Such as he looks around his warm delight,
He looks around, nor thinks of former toils,
But hails an ample harvest in your smiles.

  THE VENETIAN OUTLAW.  
  
  
  ACT I.

SCENE I. — An agreeable and picturesque Grotto
at the extremity of the Palace Gardens.  
  
  
  [ N. B. There are two avenues—one in the middle,

which is the principal, and through which part

of the garden is seen—the other on the right,

communicating with the palave by a private

door.]  
  
  
  Enter Alfieri—a letter in his hand.


Alf. (reads.) " A man once honoured with your
\"friendship has important secrets to
communi" cate, repair alone this night, at the hour of eight,
\"to the grotto in the palace gardens."—From
whom is this appointment ?—Its mystery bespeaks
an enemy rather than a friend.—(Clock strikes 8)
The hour of the rendezvous, and this the place.  
  
  
  Enter Vivaldi, in a German military habit.

Speak !—who art thou ?

Fiv. A friend—once known to Alfieri, and by
that virtuous senator beloved, valued and esteemed.

Alf. Thy person is still to me unknown—I
recollect you not.  
  
  
  B
<!-- Leaf 16, Page: 2 -->

Fiv. Look on me well,—if years of exile and
misfortune have effaced all outward traces—my
heart is still the same.—Thy unwearied friendship
for my unhappy father can never be forgotten by
his grateful son.

Alf. Be quick !—speak !—say—are you—

Fiv. Your feelings tell you who I am—Yes,
Alfien. In me beholdthe outlaw'd son of Count
Vivaldi.


Alf. Come to my arms—Heaven then has heard
my prayers, and I again press to my heart the last
surviving scion of an injured but illustrious house:
■—but alas!—this meeting may be dearly bought;
even now I tremble for thy safety—You know,
perhaps—


Fiv. That I'm proclaimed a traitor; a price is
set upon the head of him whose heart ne'er panted
but in his country's cause, and whose honest arm
was never raised but in her just defence.


Alf. But here you brave the malice of your
foes; what motive urges this temerity ?

Fiv. The noblest motive that ever occupied
the mind of man—the love implanted in our
nature to the soil that gave us being.

Alf. And yet thy country has been unjust to
thee.


Fiv. True; but still it is my country;—and
worthless is that wretch who can, with apathy,
behold the dangers of his native land.

Alf. What dangers, and what do you
propose ?—

Fiv. To die, or to obtain the repeal of that
unjust decree which proscribed my father and
myself—and by a noble effort to unite the safety of
my country with my own.

Alf. How is this to be accomplished ?  
  
  
  1
<!-- Leaf 17, Page: 3 -->

Viv. That persecutor of my family, the Count
Orsano, is at the head of a vile conspiracy, whose
object is the death of the Doge, and that of many
illustrious senators. The time, the place, and
execution of this dire tragedy are now subservient
to my will and pleasure.

Alf. Thine, Vivaldi.! thy will and pleasure?

Fiv. Start not, but grant me your attention.
Soon after that decree which exiled us from
Venice, we took refuge in Sicily, where, alas! my
father fell a victim to his grief.—Scorning to linger
out my life in solitary inactivity, I offered my
services to Charles the Fifth; as a soldier of
fortune, by the name of Walstein, I fought under
him in various countries, a rash and desperate
courage procured me the notice and favour of the
monarch.


Alf. Your purpose dawns upon me.

Fiv. 'Twas now that the Venetians sought an
officer to lead their troops sent to the assistance of
the Duke of Savoy—the Emperor offered me to
their acceptance—I fought their battles, and with
conquest crowned, laid my laurels at their feet:—
As Walstein, remunerating honours were poured
upon me by the applauding senate—upon me,
their victorious general, the deliverer of their
country; yet, as Vivaldi I was doom'd to roam a
wandering exile, or on a public scaffold meet an
ignominious death !

Alf. But the conspiracy ?—How form'd and by
whom ?


Fiv. In this embarrassment there fell into my
power a messenger dispatched to Abelino, a leader
of banditti, a man fearless and ferocious, the
freebooter, the terror of Italy, by him I learnt the
treachery of Orsano, and that the time fix'd to  
  
  
  b 1
<!-- Leaf 18, Page: 4 -->
strike the final blow was the birth-day of the
daughter of the Doge.


Alf. Unhappy Venice!—how near the crisis of
thy fate !—to-morrow celebrates the birth-day of
Rosara.


Fiv. He bore a letter which inclosed a ring, the
intended passport of Abelino to the confidence of
the conspirators; possessed of their intentions I
promised the messenger pardon unconditional,—
together with rich rewards—provided he would
deliver Abelino into my hands.—He consented,
proceeded with the letter, conducted him towards
Venice by unfrequented ways, where he was
intercepted by a party of my soldiers, and lost his life
by rash resistance.

Alf. He met the fate his bold enormities long
merited;—a grateful nation should reward the
deed.


Fiv. His death, tho' not intended, suggested
mv present project; trusting that years of unabated
sorrow and military hardships, aided bv the
improbability of my return, would prevent all
recognition. I left my troops, arrived here last
night, presented myself to the Doge, as his
victorious General Walstein, and was received with
such distinguished marks of favour as successful
soldiers meet from grateful princes. But how
shall I describe his feelings, his amazement when
I disclosed the conspiracy, and pledged my life if
he confided in my discretion to frustrate the
design, and subvert the malignant operations of his
enemies.


Alf. How can you fulfil this hazardous
engagement ?


Fiv, In this grotto the conspirators are to meet,
during the banquet which precedes the fete; the
<!-- Leaf 19, Page: 5 -->
intricacies of the palace are known to me, and
furnish'd with Orsano's letter and the ring, I shall
present myself to them as Abelino ?

Alf. Wherefore not instantly arrest Orsano as
the chief conspirator ?

Fiv. Would that be effectual? No—'twould
be only a branch lopt off; one head of that
destroyed which, Hydra-like, teems with a
multitude.


Alf. Heaven direct thy ways, and crown thy
virtuous purpose with success.

Fiv. If I succeed, I save my country, revenge
my father, restore my honour, and regain my
wife.  
  
  
  Alf. Your wife !


Fiv. 'Tis true, this union has been kept secret
even from you my most respected friend; but now
I view you as the father I have lost, even this the
dearest object of my heart, shall be disclos'd to
you: yes, Alfieri—I am the husband of Rosara.
The story of my love might pall e'en on the ear of
friendship,—let this suffice. Orsano inspired with
an equal passion for Rosara, resolved to work the
ruin of a favor'd rival. Accused my father and
myself of treason, forged proofs which wore the
face of truth, and we were condemn'd unheard.


Alf. Villain !—Villain !!!

Fiv. Mov'd by my despair, Rosara consented
to a secret marriage; but compell'd by her
intreaties, as yet the bridegroom's joys untasted, I
flew to rejoin my father, and bade adieu to this
once cherish'd spot.

Alf. Knows she of your return ?

'Fro* No !.  
  
  
  Alf. But when—you meet—
<!-- Leaf 20, Page: 6 -->

ViV, — Fear not—we have met—She knows
me not—Prudence has kept me silent—lest in the
transports of our joy, unguarded fondness might
betray us, yet love at length is victor. This letter
informs her, that her husband lives, further I dare
riot divulge; may I commit it to the friendship of
Alfieri ?


Alf. Can Vivaldi doubt my zeal to serve him—
but yet beware, my friend—consider deeply the
perils that surround you.

Fiv. The shield of justice will protect the
innocent.


Alf. Yet as Vivaldi, reflect, the decree of death
is still in force.


Fiv. I know it good Alfieri, as Walstein too I
am in danger from the daggers of the
conspirators—as Abelino, I am expos'd to suffer with
disgrace and ignomony; but if I fall 'twill be in a
glorious effort to preserve my prince, and raise
a deathless name on the safety of my native
land.


Alf. The hand of Providence protect you—I
perceive the Doge attended by the procurator
Alberti—I leave you.

Fiv. Farewell, the different characters I am
about to assume will force me into actions you may
disapprove; promise to suspend all decision on my
conduct till the result be known.  
  
  
  Alf. I promise. [Exit Alfieri.  
  
  
  Enter the Doge and Alberti—-from the gardens.


Doge. Walstein, I sought thee, thou art not
deceived, Abelino is at Venice—e'en on the gates
of my palace he has affixed this audacious notice.
<!-- Leaf 21, Page: 7 -->

Fiv. (reads) " Doge of Venice, you have been
\"inform'd of my arrival, I meant this intelligence
\"shou'd reach you thro' myself, think not you
*' can prevent the accomplishment of that great
\"design which calls me hither; your death, once
*' resolv'd, a hand unseen will strike the blow,
\"and that will be the hand of Abelino." The
daring miscreant.


Doge. Not for myself I fear, did this Abelino
aim at my life alone, little wou'd his threats affect
me—but when I revolve on all that such a wretch
is capable of undertaking, I shudder at the view
of those commotions to which devoted Venice is
expos'd.


Fiv. The danger claims a firm and powerful
opposition, the conspiracy is deeply laid—Abelino,
a fearless and intrepid villain, remorseless, fierce,
and sanguinary.

Alb. But how defeat his purpose and oppose his
menace ?


Doge. Each deep precaution must be us'd—
give instant orders that the guards be doubled.

Fiv. Hold, my Lord! your guards by secret
influence may be corrupted—let them be replac'd
by mine—men practised with me in the field of
honor—content with me to share their laurels or
to risk their lives.


Doge. What thinks't, Alberti, shall we thus
decree ?


Alb. The measure is prudent, and worthy of its
author.


Doge. Haste then, Walstein, haste, the charge
be thine, but remember, generous sir, on thy
wisdom, valour, and discretion, rests the safety of
the prince and people; our wives', our children's
prayers, shall call down blessings on thy headj.
<!-- Leaf 22, Page: 8 -->
and ages yet unborn shall hymn the praises of the
virtuous man, who checked bold treason's torrent,
and stemm'd the tide of human blood.


Viv. You little know with what propitious
hopes I hail the glorious entcrprize. I too, have
a wife—fair as the brightest of Venetian dames,
the thought of whom will nerve this arm with
tenfold strength—until the master traitor of this
hellish plot fall at my feet, a prostrate suppliant
for that mercy which, were he conqueror, he lacks
humanity to grant. [Exit Vivaldi.

Do%e. If success shou'd crown his enterprize,
what gratitude shall Venice owe to this illustrious
soldier.


Alb. Yet, my lord, to owe our safety to a
stranger, humbles the state of Venice, and gives
but too much cause for deep regret.

Doge. Yet in the present moment its wisdom
vindicates itself—a conspiracy is formed in the
very senate, acknowledged within the precincts of
my palace, when they who ought to be most
interested in its preservation, perfidious, or supine,
give neither information nor assistance, a stranger
acquaints me with the danger—braves the
vengeance of the conspirators, and offers to save the
state, or bury himself with me beneath its ruins,
so acting, this stranger ceases to be such; the
preserver of my country, he becomes my friend,
my dearest friend, nor can I thank the man who
wou'd undermine a confidence so justly placed.—
(Going, he meets  
  
  
  Calcagno, who, seeing the Doge, appears confused.)

What would Calcagno?

Cfilc. My lord J
<!-- Leaf 23, Page: 9 -->

Doge. What'wou'd you, sir?

CaU. (hesitating) Truly I would—that is—if
your grace wou'd give me leave.

Doge. Well.

Calc. Bless me, I came hither in such haste, I
had almost forgot my errand—thus it is signor—■
many of our senators, indignant at the menaces of
this assassin, Abelino, request to see you to express
their eagerness to shield you from the attempts of
this terrible, this determined ruffian, wild as an.
Asiatic boar, and as unfeeling as a rhinoceros.
(Aside) Come, that's tolerable for an extempore—
as for me, my lord, my life, nay all I possess, is at
your service.


Doge. You have my thanks. Come, Alberti—•
to the palace; at such a crisis let no private interest
engage our thoughts, but be the public safety our
only care. [Exit Doge and Alberti.

Calc. Well done, Calcagno, methinks thou
hast display'd thy genius upon this occasion—'tis
strange, that this said Doge shou'd take it into his
illustrious noddle to hold a conversation exactly
where we gentlemen reformers had resolved to
meet—reformers!—that's a vile name, tho' it
sounds loftily—members in the opposition—lords
of the minority, or something more conciliating
and senatorial, methinks, wou'd be more to my
humour. It's a fine thing, notwithstanding—that
is, if it succeeds; but if it fails, why then, we
gentlemen make a very sorry figure. Hitherto my
share of the business has been pleasant enough—
I lend upon tolerable interest good round sums.
Ffaith, I believe I have purchased the reversion
of the plunder of the bank, the ecclesiastical
domains of Saint Marco will be mine, and, egad,
I sha'nt think it sacrilege to touch them—but
<!-- Leaf 24, Page: 10 -->
suppose we fail, my property will revert to the
state, and my head to the—lud a mercy upon us
—but we won't talk of that now—treason is good
at calculation, and usury is a most excellent
accomptant, and has a knack of swelling figures
to a most enormous magnitude.  
  
  
  Enter Orsano.


Ors. What—no one arrived ? ever more tardy
—where are our friends?—they shou'd be here.  
  
  
  Calc. With submission, better not.


Ors. Why not ?

Calc. The Doge and Alberti, not many
moments since, were here in conference, and had
not I, with some fertility of fancy, let me tell
you, thought of an artifice to remove them, they
might have been here still.

Ors. Go seek our friends, say I await them.

Calc. It shall be done—why what a crabbed
face our leader wears, it chills one to look on it—
methinks he might have thank'd me for my care.
Well, well, study for the public good has made a
great man forget a private service.
[Exit Calcagno.

Ors. The decisive moment is at hand, and every
thing promises success—ungrateful Rosara, soon
shall you feel the vengeance of a slighted passion!
ihy most unjust disdain, by which eight tedious
years have been embitter'd, steels every fibre of
my heart 'gainst pity—'tis not enough, that thro'
the banishment of thy Vivaldi I have stabb'd that
cold inexorable bosom—thy death, and that of
thy weak faiher, can alone complete the measure
of my hatred—yes, Orsano!—they both shall die.
Ah! how do I despise myself, when I think my
<!-- Leaf 25, Page: 11 -->
rank and fortune have concurr'd only to make me
leader of that desperate band of worthless,
discontented men, too easily found in every country,
who rally round the standard of revolt, gilding
with treason's sophistry their crimes, and drawing
into their vortex weaker minds. No matter—the
desire of vengeance, deep and direful vengeance,
stifles all reflection or remorse, the storm is
gathering—to-morrow its thunder shall burst forth,
and annihilate my victims.  
  
  
  Enter Calcagno, Spalatia, Michaeli, and  
  
  
  others.

Welcome, gentlemen! I have expected you with
impatience—some one to prevent surprise, remain
at the entrance of the grotto.
[Exit one of the Conspirators.
Well, what news ? what new members grace our

cause.


Mich. Our members multiply; thro' every
quarter of the city I have extoll'd your moderation,
your courage, your noble and disinterested views,
and have found with pleasure the minds of the
people inflam'd against their rulers.

Ors. 'Tis well.  
  
  
  Cal. Well, 'tis excellent.


Ors. Yes, yes, but we delay too long.

Cal. No doubt on't, I said so, I have always
said that we delay too long.

Ors. You know that Abelino is at
Venice—expert, bold, and faithful—he is the fittest
instrument for our purpose—he is prodigal, 'tis true, but
this is not the hour of parsimony—he must be
supplied.  
  
  
  Mich. He shall have enough, we are rich in
<!-- Leaf 26, Page: 12 -->
resource—do we not command the purse of the
usurer Calcagno?

Cal. Banker, gentlemen—banker if you please.  
  
  
  Enter Canevaro, hastily.


Can. My friends, I fear we're lost.

Cal. There—I thought so. I knew we should
be lost.


Ors. (coolly.) Speak; what hast thou heard?

Can. At least 'tis certain we are suspected.

Cal. How ! suspected—heaven forbid—what
will become of us now—I hope they won't suspect
me.


Ors. Peace! some false alarm; what proof have
you ?

Can. The palace guard is chang'd—its numbers
doubled, and even now replac'd by soldiers under
the command of Walstein.


Ors. Indeed! then we must be alert—Walstein
has military talents, energy, and activity.

Spal. 'Tis clear he can injure us, let him be
dispos'd of.

Cal. Undoubtedly—exactly my advice—he
must be dispatch'd, get rid of him any way.

Spal. By all means, and let that office fall upon
yourself.

Cal. No, excuse me there! I did not think of
that, and had rather you did it.


Spal. It will prove your zeal to the cause—your
valour also.


Cal. I don't aim at glory.—Money you shall
have to advance your scheme, but I'll have nothing
to do with the killing part—it's quite out of my
way, you have the knack of it.  
  
  
  Spal. Well, be it my affair then,
<!-- Leaf 27, Page: 13 -->

Cal. To be sure, every man in his trade, then
matters will slip on smoothly.

[A loud knock is heard at the private door on the

left hand—they all stand motionless, and listen

with apprehension—a second knock is heard—■

Orsano, after making signs that silence should

be observed, goes softly towards the door.^

Cal. (trembling.) Mercy on us!

Car. What's that ?


Cal. {another knock.) The inquisitors
perhapsthen we are undone.


Ors. Silence dotard, (another knock.) Who's
there ?  
  
  
  Vivaldi answers without. Abelino !  
  
  
  [Some of the conspirators exclaim, Abelino ! and

all testify astonishment and satisfaction. Orsano

opens the door, and Vivaldi enters as Abelino,

with a thick black beard, wild curfd hair of

the same colour, a long cloak wrapped round

him under which is thejtab'it of a free booter—

pistols, &c. in his girdle—-forming altogether a

stern and most terrific appearance.^
Cal. (aside.) What a ferocious looking dog.
Ors. We did not expect you this evening.
Viv. I know it.—I am ever seen where I am

least expected.

Ors. How got you here unobserved ?

Viv. (points to door.) You see.

Ors. Those subterraneous passages—

Viv. Lead to the palace.

Ors. Who was your conductor hither ?

Viv. Conductor! I needed none; each deep and
secret avenue I can explore without a guide.

Cal. He looks like a babe of darkness.  
  
  
  Viv. You are the' Count Orsano !
Ors. The same. How know you that ?
<!-- Leaf 28, Page: 14 -->

Viv. No matter—here is the letter, and the ring*
you sent me.


Ors. Proofs are unnecessary. I see you as you
have been described.—A man, at whose
appearance affrighted Florence trembled.

Cal. Whose very beard would give an ague to
a continent.


Can. Pshaw ! (to Calcagno.)

Viv. I am not a man of compliments. I
studynot the language of the drawing-room.

Cal. (aside.) If you do, your face gives the lie
to the master of the ceremonies.


Viv. To business! Wherefore have you sent
for me, and to what purpose ?

Ors. To lead an enterprise worthy your
courage; and to assist in freeing Venice from
oppression.


Viv. Ay, ay, you wrote so; but how to be
employ'd?

Ors. Your name must first spread terror thro'
the city.


Viv. ft is already done.

Cal. (aside.) Or will be, when he shews himself.

Viv. My letter to the Doge effected that.

Can. 'Twas boldly done.

Ors. On you I depend to rid us of the heads of
the republic.

Viv. Their names.


Ors. The Doge—the Procurator Alberti—and
others I shall point out hereafter.

Pro. To morrow pass'd, and you shall no more
fear them.


[ He looks around with marked attention on the

persons who are present.^
Are these, the whole of your friends ?—-are these
the members that compose your enterprise ?
<!-- Leaf 29, Page: 15 -->

Ors. Only a part, the rest are not yet
comebut all are staunch, and true.  
  
  
  Viv. Yet it is necessary I should know them alt.
Ors. Here is the list.  
  
  
  Fro. Are they all mention'd ?
Ors. Without an exception.
Fiv. Give it me.  
  
  
  Ors. Be careful of it.


Fiv. Doubt me not—I mean it.

Ors. Our lives depend on it.

Fiv. (with emphasis.) I know it.

Cal. (aside.) Zounds! he knows every thing;
(whispers Orsano.) Is my name there?

Ors. Certainly.

Cal. And will you let him have it.

Ors. Why not? what should we fear.

Cal. Don't be rash, what will not men do to
enrich themselves—such ill-looking rogues, are
capable of any thing—how do you know what
use he may make of it.

Ors. (aside to Calcagno) That's true!—(turns to
Vivaldi) return the list.

Fiv. Do you suspect Abelino?

Mich. Till tried all men should be suspected.

Car. As yet you have done nothing to deserve
our confidence.


Fiv. Command—I am ready.

Ors. Mark then ! an action worthy your
address and reputation, that will put your constancy
to the test is open to you—the death of Rosara,
the daughter of the Doge.

Fiv. (aside) My wife—Rosara ?

Ors. Her fatal beauty attaches to her father's
party the most illustrious men in Venice—they
seek his friendship in hopes of obtaining his
<!-- Leaf 30, Page: 16 -->
(laughter's hand, and his immense possessions—if
Rosara die—that hope's destroy'd, and he will be
abandoned by his best supporters.

Viv. (with affected indifference) With so many
other means to ensure success—can a woman s
death be of such vast importance ?


Mich. What, you hesitate. / then, will
undertake it.


Fiv. (recovering his former stern manner) Think'st
thou I shrink—thou mistak'st.


Ors. The task be thine Michaeli—on second
thoughts 'twere best—you Abelino, have never
seen Rosara, and her beauty might palsey even
your bold arm.

Fro. 'Tis true these hands have never yet been
bathed in female blood—but Rosara!—the
daughter of the Doge too—methinks there I could do

my duty.

Ors. No matter, it shall be Michaeli.


Mich. A woman ! 'tis too insignificant a task for
you, something greater befits your hand—the Doge
for instance!


Fiv. Villain! (aside) the Doge!—well, be it so.

Ors. It is time to separate; to lull suspicion—
let us appear to take our share in the rejoicings;
but before we part, let us ratify the solemn
compact we have entered into—let us swear upon this
sword to be faithful to the cause we have
embraced, ?.nd to die, or to be deliverers of Venice.  
  
  
  Alb. We swear!


Fiv. (with much emphasis) Yes, I swear to die,
cr be the deliverer of Venice.
(A Conspirator speaks from tlic Entrance of the
Grotto.—Rosara approaches )

Ors. Return quickly to the palace—disperse  
  
  
  S
<!-- Leaf 31, Page: 17 -->
yourselves different ways—fly you, through the
secret door.  
  
  
  They exit different ways, except Michaeli

and Vivaldi.


Mich, /shall remain. (Muttering.)

Fiv. Wherefore ?

Mich. The opportunity must not be lost.

Fiv. What do you propose ?

Mich. To execute my purpose here.

Fiv. Indeed! is there no fear?

Mich. You talk of fear—you, who—

Fiv. (with a pretended ferocious laugh) 'Twas
but to try you.

Mich. Was it so ? Know then—I fear nothing—
go—leave me—to-morrow you shall hear of me.

Fiv. Perhaps to-night.
[Exit, seemingly, by the private door~—but
darts behind a part of the Grotto.

Michaeli having turned round perceives the
private door open—he conceives Abelino has retired by
that passage, and shuts it with caution, looks out
and says—" She comes!  
  
  
  He retires.  
  
  
  Enter Rosara. A Letter in her Hand.


Ros. No, I cannot believe this excess of
rapture after so long, so cruel a separation—shall I
again behold thee, most amiable, the most
belov'd of men, shall I be permitted to call thee
husband—to pour into thy faithful bosom, all the
sorrows, all the tenderness of an impassion'd heart,
still another day of expectation.—Ah ! each
moment of the tedious interim will seem an age—
but why so much reserve, why not fly to me the
instant of his arrival.—Alas! does he not dread  
  
  
  C
<!-- Leaf 32, Page: 18 -->
discovery—might he not fear that in the
transports of my joy, I shou'd betray our secret.'—
No—be assured most dear Vivaldi—this heart
that languish'd for thy presence, now bounds with
transport to receive thee—and longs to clasp thee
in these faithful arms.  
  
  
  
[She pauses over the letter with tenderness.
Michaeli, advances, and speaks low as
to himself.]
Mic. All is safe—now then—or never!  
  
  
  [Alichaeli is m the act of stabbing her, when

Vivaldi springs out, seizes his arm—

wrests the dagger from him, and kills

hbn.~\  
  
  
  Viv. Die, villain !
Ros. Oh heaven!
Fiv. Silence!


Ros. (turning—beholds his face with horror.) An
assassin!—murder!  
  
  
  Viv. Thy preserver!
Ros. Help—help—the powers of heavenprotect me!!!


Viv. (holding her) Be silent, be
discreet.—Abelino watches over you'

Ros. Abelino (with a loud scream, and hiding
her face with her hands, several voices, without
the grotto, cry this way, this way.)

/ iv. Hark ! they come—farewell.
[Pressing her to his arms, while she with
horror avoids him, he rushes out at the

private door; at that instant the Doge,
Alberti, and servants enter.]

Doge, (exclaiming as he enters.) What mean their
cries? My child !

Ros. (who has staggered to a pillar.) Says, My
father! oh ! my fitther! he was here, HE.

  ACT II.  
  
  
  SCENE II.—The Portico of the Palace.

Orsano and Canevaro—enter on opposite sides.

Can. From whence, my friend, proceeds the
satisfaction so visible in your countenance ?

Ors. Our success is infallible (with joy.)

Can. Indeed !


Ors. This letter which Vivaldi has lately sent
to Rozara, furnishes the means of turning all
suspicion upon him.

Can. Vivaldi at Venice?  
  
  
  Ors. Himself informs us of it.
Can. 'Tis strange.


Ors. By heav'ns 'tis wonderful,—imprudent
Vivaldi thou brav'st all dangers; but, presumptuous
youth, thy rashness a second time draws the
avenging bolt upon thee, nor shall it fall with an
unsparing hand.—

Can. How came this letter into your possession ?

Ors. 'Twas found near the Grotto, soon after
Rosara had been there.—  
  
  
  Can. What is your design ?—  
  
  
  c 2
<!-- Leaf 34, Page: 20 -->

Ors. See'st thou not the double triumph the
occasion offers, a rival soon removed beyond the
fear of further harm, while plausibility shall wrest
the meaning of his love-sick phrase, and turn
suspicion wholly upon him.—Oh glorious thought!
worthy our wrongs and views, a task remains
fitting the genius of Abelino; he shall effect an
interview with the Doge, and demand the pardon of
Vivaldi.—A damning proof of his connexion with
the conspirators, and while the troops are
dispersed to seek Vivaldi.—

Can. We strike the blow,  
  
  
  Ors. And victory must follow.
Can. Hazardous is the attempt, think you

Abelino will risk it?


Ors. Can you doubt him ? besides, I shall be
present at the interview without his suspecting it,
and let him beware he does not deceive us. The
Doge approaches, leave us together.  
  
  
  [Exit Canevara.
Orsano, alone.


Ors. Aid me, dissimulation, till I have spread
the net that shall ensnare my destined prey!
Triumphant fancy dwells with rapture on the
moment, when with undaunted countenance I shall
proclaim, " this work is mine.'" If friendship
slighted, if ambition thwarted, if love despised
be wrongs, shall not I stand acquitted; tho' that
soft passion rendered furious by despair, becomes
a deep and deadly hate.  
  
  
  Enter the Doge.


Ors. (to the Doge.) My lord, at this alarming
moment, when secret murmurs of conspiracy and
vengeance disturb the public mind, when
<!-- Leaf 35, Page: 21 -->
suspicion falls even on the most respected senators—
chance, or rather I should say, the interposing
hand of heaven, has granted me a proof most
incontestible of their integrity; and of the crimes
of a man already sentenced by the laws. I lament
that to vindicate the innocent and detect the
guilty, I must accuse a person justly dear to you,
but to the general safety all private feelings must
be sacrificed, and I obey the dictates of an
imperious duty. (Giving the letter.)

Doge. Of whom do you speak ?

Ors. That paper will inform you. [Exit.

Doge, [looks after Orsano with an air of
surprise, and opening the letter, exclaims Vivaldi! !!]
(reads.) " After eight years of cruel separation,
\"thy faithful lover returns to Venice," (with
indignation.) Her lover! " my unsteady hand
trem" bles with excess of rapture while I trace the
\"words returns to thee, beloved Rosara;
nmpor" tant reasons have hitherto opposed my ardent
\"desire to behold you! but you will soon learn
\"how much my love is capable of effecting.
\"Great events are preparing;" (the Doge musing.)
Great events! " ere two days are past, I hope to
\"have the power publicly to declare the tender
\"ties by which we are united, and obtain the
re" peal of my unjust proscription.—Implore of
11 heaven to favour the purposes of thy faithful
« Vivaldi."


(The Doge continues.) This then unravels all—
implore of heaven ! Impious mockery ! It is not
to be doubted.—This traitor hopes for the
conclusion of his exile, and the success of this love,
which I abhor, by means, which Walstein's care
and our own power shall frustrate; yes, these
projects shall be defeated. Tremble perfidious
<!-- Leaf 36, Page: 22 -->
Rosara, unworthy daughter ! It is thou who first
shall feel the weight of my resentment.

[Rosara crosses the bottom of the stage as if in

search of something, when she sees her father

she appears alarm d, and exclaims]

Ros. My father, and a letter in his hand ! should
it be mine!—(She is going.)

Doge, (turning round.) My daughter! (to her.)
Approach, look on this letter, know you ought
concerning it ?  
  
  
  Ros. (timidly.) Sir!
Do"c. Answer me ! From whom does it come ?
Ros. (terrified.) Alas !
Doge, (with wci eased anger.) Name him !
Ros. Honour forbids me.  
  
  
  Doge. A father commands thee.
Ros. Oh! Spare me, spare me!
Doge. Is Vivaldi at Venice ?
Ros. I have not seen him.


Doge. Disobedient girl! are you aware of the
danger you incur by holding correspondence with
a criminal, who is every hour liable to suffer by
the sentence of the law.


Ros. (concealing her face and weeping.) Suffer!
dreadful idea! lost Vivaldi.


Doge. And have you no fears of my
resentment? when you thus display with matchless
confidence, even in my presence, the interest with
which he has inspired you.

Ros. Ah! may I not shudder at all those
dangers, to which for me he is exposed ?

Doge. For thee ! say rather because he would
betray his countrv, and assassinate thy father!

Ros. He ! Vivaldi! He an assassin ! His soul  
  
  
  abhors such crimes;—he! whose gentle nature, an
<!-- Leaf 37, Page: 23 -->
eight years cruel persecution, could not stimulate
even to deeds of retribution.


Doge. Each concurring circumstance adds
confirmation to his guilt.

Ros. You are deceived—the malignant breath
of calumny has sullied his fair fame—but let his
accusers dread the justice of avenging Providence.

Doge. The decree then which condemned him—

Ros. Was most unjust.

Doge. The proofs ?

Ros. Were forged.

Doge. Flis accuser ?

Res. A monster, who in revenge of my
contempt, thus persecutes the most loyal subject; the
most zealous friend of peace and public order;
but Time, that slow yet certain minister of justice,
who draws from its dark covert the most secret
villainy will finally exculpate my Vivaldi.—That
ignominy and disgrace now cast on him, will be
transferred to his oppressors : you then, my father,
will repent your injustice, but it will be too late;
tho' innocent he will have fallen a victim; and you,
you my father, will have destroyed the life of
him, who weuld die a thousand deaths to hold
once more that place within thy worthy heart, of
which matchless villainy has cruelly deprived
him.


Doge. But what motive impels thee to
undertake his cause ?


Ros. Every motive human and divine calls
forth the wife's exertions in a husband's cause.


Doge. Husband ! Vivaldi thy husband ! sooner
would I see thee expiring at my feet, this weapon
in thy heart, than behold thee wedded to Vivaldi.

Ros. Strike then, for Vivaldi is my husband.
<!-- Leaf 38, Page: 24 -->

Doge, (with the greatest surprise.) Thy
husband !


Ros. O ! check, that rising frown, my father !
'tis thy suffering daughter that entreats thee ! had
my gentle mother lived, I had not now wanted an
advocate to plead my cause with an offended
father—that lamented parent join'd our hands, and
seal'd our union with a mother's blessing.—The
misfortunes of Vivaldi she knew and pitied, his
innocence she never doubted, she meant to reveal
the secret of our marriage, when the hand of
truth had removed the dark veil of prejudice, and
the injured Vivaldi should appear before my father
in his native garb, pure, guiltless, and unspotted.

Doge. What! would'st thou make thy departed
mother partner in thy guilt?

Ros. (kneels.) As I hope for heaven's
forgiveness, and for thine, my father—in her presence was
performed the sacred rites that made us one; on
that accursed day when Vivaldi's cruel sentence
was pronounced; and even at the altar did we
part, perhaps, alas! never to meet again.

Doge. Nor shall you ever meet again. I
command you to renounce Vivaldi, banish the traitor
for ever from thy thoughts.

Ros. Never! (throws herself at his feet.)
Pardon, my father, but you demand a sacrifice
bevond my strength.

Doge. A wretched outcast, a wandering
miscreant.


Ros. His misfortunes render him still dearer to
me—for me he braves the prospect of an
ignominious death, and sh.ill I abandon him in the hour
of peril ?—never! never! never! —  
  
  
  Doge. Will you then cover with shame my few
<!-- Leaf 39, Page: 25 -->
remaining years, and heap disgrace upon thy
father?


Ros. Can I give up my husband ?

Doge. Husband ! that name awakens all my
fury. Remember, Rosara, my sentence may be
terrible.


Ros. Pronounce it; I will submit without
complaining, (she i lings to him.) Look not so
dreadfully upon me; let these tears, this anguish, wake
the father in thee, and plead for pity on his
hapless child.


[During this speech the Doge traverses the stage

in the height of anger and agitation, Rosara

following him in the most supplicating manner.]

Doge, (repulsing her.) If thou would'st avoid
thy father's curse—

Ros. (oppress^ by her fathers anger and
overcome with grief, she sinks on a sofa.) O mercy !
mercy!  
  
  
  Enter Vivaldi, as Walstein


Viv. (looks at Rosara with great tenderness, and
exclaims.) Good heaven ! what's the matter ?

Doge, (with warmth and in agitation to Vivaldi.)
Walstein, you find me here distracted, torn with
conflicting passions, listen to the cause; the son of
the Count Vivaldi, long since condemned to die
who has hitherto escaped the arm of justice, is
returned to Venice.


Viv. (aside, as if he fear d discovery.) Indeed!

Doge. Not satisfied with former treasons, and
the dishonour of my family, which this letter too
plainly reveals, (shelving him the letter,) he has
joined the discontented faction, e'en now, perhaps,
<!-- Leaf 40, Page: 26 -->
plotting our destruction, and would doubtless
enjoy his victory, tho' raised upon the ruin of his
country. Read—

Viv. (aside.) No, it cannot be; all is safe, it is
certain now he knows me not.


Doge. So daring an attempt, I see confounds
thee.  
  
  
  Viv. I am indeed confounded.


Doge. Thy honest heart can scarce believe it
real.


Viv. When great depravities present
themselves, I am ever slow in credit, and pity the
weakness of our imperfect nature.

Doge. For you is reserved the honour of
delivering us from this traitor, employ every means
to secure his person; and, if possible, before
tomorrow pass, let him, on a scaffold, expiate his
crimes.


Ros. (recovering more feifectly.) Expiate on a
scaffold—who ? Vivaldi ? Vivaldi's crimes !


Doge. This prompt execution may alarm his
accomplices, and avert the threaten'd storm.

Ros. Ye powers of mercy end this conflict in
my breast, or give me death or power to save my
husband!


Doge. Promise me then, that to-morrow
Vivaldi shall be in my power.

Ros. (rushing towards Vivaldi with (error.) Oh !
do not, do not promise.

Viv. [with, composure.) I not only promise, I
swear it—Vivaldi shall be in thy power.

Ros. Inhuman monster.—recall thy oath !

Doge, (to Vivaldi.) Your word is sacred.

Ros. (following the Doge.) Hear me, my
father !
<!-- Leaf 41, Page: 27 -->
  
  Doge. Away—I will not be entreated. [Exit.

[Vivaldi is going out on the opposite side,
Ro
sara follows him.


Ros. Stay—I beseech you, sir—

Viv. (aside.) Madam—my duty calls me hence,
dreaded conflict ! !


Ros. Till this moment never did I think a
warrior crowned with fame and public gratitude,
could seek for glory by persecuting the
unfortunate, or in pursuing the victims of calumny and
injustice: but I deceived myself—I see that there
are men who hold all actions to be laudable which
aid their selfish and ambitious views. No spark
of sacred pity glows within such callous bosoms—
the murdered husband and despairing wife, to
them are equally indifferent.

Viv. (with embarrassment, endeavouring to avoid
Rosara's looks.) Madam, it is to me alone the fate
of Vivaldi ought to be entrusted.

Ros. How does he merit your hatred ?

Viv. Heaven is my witness, I hate him not.

Ros. Yet you aid the fury of his enemies.

Viv. He is accused of treason.


Ros. Vivaldi guilty of treason ?—he whose
earliest years were marked with triumph—he, for
whose deeds of valour, his country's acclamations
have rent the vaulted sky; but, beware, the hero
may yet break forth from the dark cloud that now
obscures him, and even you, who have engaged to
drag him to the scaffold, may meet a courage that
will make your boasted valour sink beneath his
manly arm.


Viv. (coolly.) I do not doubt his valour, madam,
nor fear his prowess.


Ros. Well, then, fear from the despair of an
adoring wife—woe to the man who shall consign
<!-- Leaf 42, Page: 28 -->
him to the fury of his persecutors—his blood shall
pay the price of his compliance.

Fiv. (aside.) Oh ! precious moments—blest
recompence for an eternity of pain !

Ros. (with more calmness.) But alas ! grief
bewilders me; I forgot, that, faithful to your duty,
your heart must be as inaccessible to feeling as to
fear.


Fiv. (forgetting himself.) Think not I blame
this tenderness—I shall betray myself, (aside).
(Recovering his former cold manner.) But I am
astonished that, yielding to the voice of reason,
you do not strive to forget a man.

Ros. (with the greater feeling.) Forget him!
ah no! first must this wretched heart forget to
beat! (with the greatest earnestness) I conjure you,
noble Walstein, sully not the lustre of a glorious
life by this cruel action, which, while it
dishonours you, will plunge a dagger into my heart—it
is no longer an enraged woman, who presumes to
threaten vengeance—it is a wife bathed in tears,
who renouncing all pride of birth, thus lowly
supplicates you to preserve her husband (kneeling
to Vivaldi)—your generous heart, guarded by
pity, will escape remorse—will triumph in
beholding those you have made happy—once more on
her knees the unhappy Rosara.

Fiv. (aside.) Longer to resist her is impossible !
(aloud, and wit h the most tender tone and action
offering to raise her) beloved Rosara ! behold in
Walstein that adoring husband.

Ros. (at first repulses him, then suddenly, as if
struck with astonishment, exclaims) What said'st
thou ? can it be ? no, no, my eyes deceive me—
(looking stedfastly at him) it cannot be my lov'd
Vivaldi!
<!-- Leaf 43, Page: 29 -->

Viv. (throwing off his cap, and putting his hair
aside from his forehead.) Yes, my Rosara, here
behold thy husband, whose sorrows vanish from
this blissful moment!


Ros. (throwing herself in his arms.) It is—it
must be he—dearest Vivaldi! (From the joy of the
moment she repeats his name very hud.)

Viv. Beware.  
  
  
  Ros. Alas! I shall betray you.
Alf. (enters.) Incautious lovers, you will be

surprised.

Ros. Oh heaven!  
  
  
  Alf. Calcagno comes this way.
Viv. Fear not, my love!
Ros. Cruel interruption.  
  
  
  Enter Calcagno.


Calc. (to Rosara J Come, this is fortunate, I
thought I should find you here. Ah, madam,
permit me to convey to you the regret of your
friends, who are impatient at your absence, which
deprives the fete of its most brilliant ornament—
may I flatter myself that you will allow me the
superlative honour of conducting you to the scene
of gaiety and pleasure ? The masks and gondolias
are all arrived; the dancers have prepared an
elegant performance; every thing promises a superb
entertainment. We shall be all life and gaiety,
fun, flappets, and finery !

Ros. (to Calcagno.) We'll follow, sir.

Calc. I can't suffer it—never budge before the
ladies, madam.  
  
  
  Viv. I take my leave.
Ros. Do you quit us, sir ?
<!-- Leaf 44, Page: 30 -->

Viv. Duty, madam, (to Rosara in a low voice)
and our safety requires it.

Ros. (giving her hand to VivaldiJ We shall
soon meet again.


Viv. (aside to Rosara.) The moment it is in my
power (aloud) I shall be impatient to have the
honour of attending you.

(IVInle Calcagno seems to speak to Alfieri, Vivaldi
attempts to kiss the hand of Rosara, but Calcagno
returns, which prevents him; he takes the hand of
Rosara, and as he leads her off with much ceremony,
she turns frequently round to make signs to her
husband, but is as often prevented by Calcagno, who in
his attentions to Rosara disconcerts both. The
ensuing scene ought to be conducted with much haste and
mystery.)


Viv. My worthy friend, I am now in need of
thy assistance.

Alf. Speak—

Viv. I must have have an interview with the
Doge as Abelino.


Alf. When?

Viv. This night.

Alf Where ?

Viv. Contrive by some means to lead him
towards the grotto at the close of the
entertainment.  
  
  
  Alf. Will you be there ?
Viv. I must.


Alf. Is it not dangerous ?

Viv. It is necessary to obtain from the
conspirators that unbounded confidence, without which
I cannot succeed. Orsano forces me to this step,
but it will be fatal to him—for there I acquaint the
Doge with the artifice I have made use of; the
<!-- Leaf 45, Page: 31 -->
names of the conspirators, and the time fixed for
the execution of their project.

Alf. But if they should detect you before he is
fully informed ?

Fro. I'll hazard every thing, the sight of my
Rosara has encreased my ardour.

Alf. The company approaches, rely upon my
friendship—

Fiv. (firmly.) I have already proved it.  
  
  
  Scene changes to another part of the palace

gardens—a canal at the bottom—with a low

wall or ballustrade, and an opening in the centre

to go down to the canal, on which are seen

gondolas superbly ornamented, filled with
nms
queraders, who ascend into the gardens, and

form various dances. The gardens are
bril
liantly illuminated—The Doge and his suite,

Alberti, Calcagno, Rosara, Ladies
at
tending her, Alfieri, Orsano, other
con
spirators, &c. arrive successively, and seat

themselves to witness the festivities.—During

the dances, Alfieri, disguised in a domino,

approaches the Doge mysteriously.


Alf. (to the Doge.,) Beware—dangers await
you—your life depends upon a moment; have
you the courage to hazard an interview with one
who means to insure your safety ? Dare you
dismiss your friends and wait his coming near the
grotto ?

Doge. I dare and will—

(Alfieri glides off-—the Doge remains absorbed
in thought while the dances continue; at length he
rises and departs with his friends, having firstcom7
<!-- Leaf 46, Page: 32 -->
manded (by his action) Rosara to retire; by
degrees the rest of the company disperse—)  
  
  
  Scene changes to a remote part of the garden near

the grotto—moon-li^ht—the canal still seen at

the top of the stage.—The Doge enters—


Do^e. What can this mean ? Each minute new
mysteries arise—new dangers present themselves—
still I disdain the thought of shrinking, tho' it
prove my bitterest foe—and am impatient to
behold this person.

(Here Orsano appears among the trees, but riot
so as to be seen by the Doge, who advances
towards the t'p of the stage, as ij he ivas
ruminating on his sitiuiiion, when Vivaldi disguised as
Abelino, suddenly issues from a rude recess, and
says.)


I ~iv. I am that person; (aside.) Orsano I
perceive observes me, I must change my purpose,
and appear the friend of his detested schemes.

(Orsano hastily retires, but \ lvaldi's sudden
entrance had given him time to observe him.)

Doge. Who art thou ?

Fro. I am that mysterious agent who has made
all Florence, and even your boasted Venice
tremble; and on whom at this moment thy lifedepends.

(During this whole Scene, Vivaldi at intervals
turns his head to see if he is ohservtd—Orsano as
often, retires, but not quick enough to avoid being
seen at times—and he gives frequent, but silent
demonstrations of his approbation at those passages in
Abelino's conversation, that are most likely to
please him.)
<!-- Leaf 47, Page: 33 -->
  
  Doge. Abelino !
Fro. The same.  
  
  
  Doge. What seek you here ?
Viv. Thee.  
  
  
  Doge. Is it my life thou aim'st at ?
Fiv. Yes.


Doge. Villain ! dost thou not fear the
vengeance of offended Heaven ?


Viv. No :—for on that earth where vile
oppression treads with steps secure—he that bravely
ventures in a glorious cause, will meet protection
from the hand of Heaven.


Doge. Know'st thou not, that by my power I
can consign thee to instant punishment;—nay,
immediate death.


Viv. Thou can'st not—nay, thou dar'st not
do it.


Djge. Who's there ? My guards! —

Fiv. In vain you call them.—Thy guards are
faithless, thy spies corrupted. Think'st thou I
would present myself before thee, had I any thing
to fear ? In a word, it is you that are in my
power—


Doge. In thy power! degrading thought! strike
then—


Viv. No, thou yet may'st live.

Doge. Wretch !

Viv. Why that disdainful tone ? It is not an
exalted station—no not the imperial purple, that
can give a noble mind; and under this rugged
garb perhaps I bear a heart more tender, more
generous than thy own.

Doge. Would'st thou compare me to an
assassin ?


Vv. No :—the assassin dooms his victim to
immediate death; his deeds are merciful to thine.  
  
  
  D
<!-- Leaf 48, Page: 34 -->
—Hast thou not abused the sacred power that
Providence to thee hath delegated, and stretched
oppression's iron-hand to wrong the innocent ?

Di-jge. Dar'st thou interrogate me thus ?

Viv. Thou hast done this—But I, faithful to
my principles, firm in my projects, suffer no
consideration of my person's safety—no sense of
danger to shake my purpose, vile as you think me.
■—Abelino, reared to acts of violence, who, did
it suit with his design, would seize thy purse or
plunge a dagger in thy heart, is guiltless when
compared to him who, trained to virtue, and
called by his approving country to be the guardian
of its laws, becomes the slave of prejudice, and
permits the penalty due only to the guilty, to fall
upon the head of innocence—

Doge. If thou canst reason thus, and from both
good and evil draw the moral inference; and yet
pursue a life of rapine, thou art indeed what the
world reports thee—a man eccentric as thy name's
terrific—


Viv. I would be so.—It is my ambition, that
when ages have rolled by—when the ploughshare
shall pass over the soil where palaces have stood—
my deeds shall be rever'd with retrospective
wonder—my name shall still be heard while thine and
that of others, who, now with cold contempt
behold me, shall be no more remembered—


Doge. Ambition well directed obtains a fame to
be indeed desired—Grateful monuments (gifts of
a nation's love) are reared, to record to remotest
ages the glory of the patriot who saved, or the
warrior who died for his countrv.—But the fame
to which thou aspirest, the fruit of daring and
successful crimes, will gain thee only an
immortality of infamy.—Hear me, Abelino—the
<!-- Leaf 49, Page: 35 -->
conspiracy which brings thee to Venice may fail of its
expected success. Take my counsel—return to
Florence.—I promise thee a full and unconditional
pardon—provided thou revealest to me the names
of the conspirators, and immediately depart from
the Venetian territory.—

(Orsano here gives great attention.)

Viv. Pardon ! pardon from thee ! thee, who
art completely in my power—But where it
otherwise—think'st thou the life you proffer could
stimulate me to a breach of faith and honour ?
No, not all thy boasted Venice can bestow could
bribe the outlaw'd Abelino to betray his meanest
friend.—Thou desirest me to leave the states of
the republic—No ! a powerful interest binds me
to this spot—Upon one condition only shall I e'er
consent to quit it 


Doge. Name it.

Fiv. (offering a paper ) Sign this paper.

Doge. What does it contain ?

Fiv. The pardon of Vivaldi.

Doge. Vivaldi ! my suspicions are confirmed—
(aside.) Never can I sign Vivaldi's pardon—

Viv. You signed his condemnation.

Doge. Justice and honour compelled me to the

act.  
  
  
  Fiv. Vivaldi is innocent.


Doge. When you become his advocate, the
traitor seems doubly guilty—

Fiv. Obdurate man ! dost thou not fear
exciting my resentment, when thus you persevere in
obstinate refusal ?


Doge. I can smile at the assassin's threats, but
shall not act in open contradiction to honour,
duty, conscience, and the sacred trust committed  
  
  
  D 2
<!-- Leaf 50, Page: 36 -->
to my care.—To Vivaldi's pardon I never can
consenc, nor can thy dagger's point enforce it.
(Vivaldi detains him—the Doge Offears</./

/;■:•. Fear nothing; had thy death been my
immediate purpose, I should not thus expostulate.
—Once more, if future fame and glory be worth
thy care, I beseech thee grant me the pardon of
Vivaldi.  
  
  
  Doge. Never !
Ftv. Well then, I swear never to take rest till I

have obtained it ! I will not employ violence—
yourself shall offer it—-you shall proclaim his
innocence, and thy own injustice to a wondering
world—


Doge. Audacious villain !—this is too much.
What, ho! my guards—will no one hear, ah !
(in much agitation.) Steps, approach—tremble
daring ruffian ! No longer shalt thou brave me
with impunity.

Fiv. I leave thee now—but anon thou'11 see me
when I am least expected 

(Advancing toward the canal.)

Doge, (intercepting him.) Stay !

(\l\\ aldi draws a pistol from his gird/e, saving,
\"Stir not," and fires it off-—at the moment of his
doing so, a gondola appears, he springs into it and
goes off exclaiming.)

Ftv. Farewell ! I shall keep my vow.

Doge. And shall such a villain escape
unpunished.  
  
  
  Enter Alberti with Ocsano, Canevaro, &t.&c.  
  
  
  and Servants hearing Torches.

Alb. What has happened ? you appear alarmed,
niy lord !
<!-- Leaf 51, Page: 37 -->

Doge. I am indeed. Would you believe it!
Abelino has been here.


Alb. Abelino ! (all present testify the greatest
surprise). Astonishing ! every hour procures new
proofs of his audacity.

Doge. But now he threw himself into a gondola
that seemed to wait his signal, and thus escaped—

(Here the gondola is seen at a great distance,
Abelino waving his hat.)—See, see, where he goes,
fly Alberti, haste to intercept him—(Alberti and
others go off hastily; Orsano by a significant
motion, giving some of his party to understand, that
Abelino must not be taken, upon which two or three
of the conspirators accompany Alberti.)—I know not
what to think ! He has inspired a feeling, and an
awe till now unknown to me !


Can. Why, my lord, would you expose
yourself to this encounter ?


Doge. Think'st thou I could hesitate between
my country's safety and my own ? Ah ! no—and
surely in her cause I had fallen with glory, tho'
by an assassin's hand—

Ors. I must attribute the danger you have
incurred to the unbounded confidence you repose in
strangers.


Can. To no other cause. Why did not the
guards obey your call ?


Cal. That is what I was going to observe; but
you are always before hand with me.

Ors. Why did not Walstein attend the fete ?

Cal. Exactly my remark; if you had but given
me time to make it.


Ors. Let him be summoned to appear before
the council, and answer for his conduct.

Cal. Precisely my idea, if you would but
allow me leisure to think of it—
<!-- Leaf 52, Page: 38 -->

Do%e. Why, by a premature severity, should
we alienate the affections of a man who may be
faithful to his duty?


Ors. This measure cannot disgrace him; for, if
he be wrong'd by our suspicions, his justification
will be public and complete.  
  
  
  Enter Alberti.


Dore. Well—Abclino ?—

Alb. Has escaped.

Ors. (aside.) I breath again.

Alb. I saw him dart from the gondola, glide
swiftly across the garden, and enter the Palace.

Doge. The Palace!—impossible! —

Alb. 'Tis most certain—hast'ning to that side
on which he entered; I called to the guards to

him, not one obeyed.


Can. No doubt remains. Walstein is a traitor.
Believe us, Sir! Dismiss your present guards,
placed round you by Walstein, and order his
arrest.


Alb. On this act of firmness our's and the
general safety may deprnd.

Do^e. The council shall be immediately
convened—you, Alberti, take these measures you shall
judge most effectual for the arrest of Walstein,
and our personal safety —Let moderation guide
your steps—and remember mercy is the monarch's
noblest attribute. (Exit Doge and Alberti.)

[Orsano, 8tc. remain. He cot-leas the
conspirators around him and addresses them.]

Ors. From this our first success, augur we
favourably of the future. No longer need we
fear resistance from this upstart stranger, since his
disgrace is certain. Is not this Abelino an
<!-- Leaf 53, Page: 39 -->
astonishing character ? Despising danger, what
services will he not render us ?


[To them, enter Spalatro, with a hurried and
alarmed appearance.]

Spal. My friends, you are deceived.

Ors. By whom ?

Spal. By Abelino.

Ors. The proof ? (coolly.)

Spal. Michaeli is murdered!

Ors. Murdered! by whom ?

Spal. I was crossing the gardens with the
intention of joining you, when passing the Grotto a
faint groan reached my ear. I entered and
perceived Michacli, bathed in blood, and in the
agonies of death. I called him by his name. He
knew me. I questional him—but he could only
point to his wound, and murmur'd Abelino as he
expired.

Cal. He's a devil! I would not be alone with
that man for all the cash in my coffers.  
  
  
  Ors. Peace!


Sjial. You remember how he hesitated when
the death of Rosara was proposed to him.

Cal. Yes, 1 remarked that he was agitated.

Ors. It is scarcely to be credited—but if he be
false to us, he shall die !—one of you undertake
to watch him.


Cal. An excellent thought!—I always said he
should be watched.


Ors. (To Calcagno.) You, for instance—you will
be least likely to create suspicion.

Cal. (with signs of fear) I! Lord bless you—
I! I'm of such a drowsy constitution, I should
make the worst watchman in the universe!


Ors. (sternly.) Would you be thought a
coward ?
<!-- Leaf 54, Page: 40 -->

Cal. By no means.—But permit me to observe
there is a trifling difficulty to watch a man, we
should know where he lives, where he goes to
—now we know nothing of him—besides, I really
must be insured from sleeping.

Ors. No hesitation—Spalatro shall go with you.

Cal. Oh that—alters the case—I dare say
I shall watch well enough in company.

Ors. Let our measures in the mean time be so
arranged, that the whole may be executed at the
same moment. One of you go thro' the city,
and bring an exact account of the different posts.
Another to the harbour, and command those
captains of gallies, who are in our interest, to be
ready to land and join us at the first signal. A
third proceed to the arsenal. The governor is
our friend, and will supply us with arms. Others
must mingle with the Doge's guards, at the gates
of the palace, to point out those who are of our
party, and prevent the entrance of such as are
against us. I shall take my place in council,
which meets at ten. At eight, let every one
attend to receive my latest orders.

Spal. I undertake to report the situation of the
city. [Exit.

Car. I'll to the arsenal. [Exit.

Another Cons. I'll to the gallies.  
  
  
  Cal. I'll—go home to bed.

[After looking about and perceiving all to he

gone, as he hobbles off] Spalatro returns in

search of him.]

<!-- Leaf 55, Page: 41 -->
  
  ACT III,  
  
  
  SCENE I.—An Ante-chamber of the Palace.  
  
  
  Enter Orsano.


Ors. How slow time creeps! How tedious to
my ardent wishes for complete revenge.—My
future fate, the colour of my life; nay, life itself,
depends on this important hour—and nothing yet
performed; none of my emissaries yet returned.
—At length—  
  
  
  Enter Calcagno.

Oh, Calcagno—thou hast held me long in pain.
—Speak—what hast thou heard ?

Cal. Your Abelino is a devil—a very devil
incarnate.


Ors. You have not then been able to secure
him ?


Cal. Secure him truly!—on the contrary, he
could have secured us had it been his pleasure.

Ors. Explain yourself more clearly.

Cal. He is not alone—there's more of them.  
  
  
  Ors. How know you this ?
Cal. I know it to my cost; I have seen, heard

and felt them.—


Ors. Will you ever explain?

Cal. Shall I relate all that pass'd ?

Ors. (impatiently.) Certainly—go on—go on!

Cal. According to your orders, Spalatro and
myself approach'd the Palace;—we questioned the
sentinels as to the place where they lost sight of  
  
  
  1
<!-- Leaf 56, Page: 42 -->
this most interesting gentleman;—they insisted
that he had only p'ass'd the first court, when
he disappeared, and must have entered a house
in it's vicinity, which the darkness did not
permit me to distinguish clearly;—but it is near
that of the Senator Alfieri. I dispatched
Spalatro to watch the back part of this dwelling,
and inspired by a daring courage, I took my
post in front;—but as able generals never
expose themselves unnecessarily, I concealed
myself in a corner to make my observations
unperceived-—snug!  
  
  
  Ors. Well?


Cal. Five hours three quarters, two minutes
and ses'en seconds, did I remain in this blessed
state—day began to dawn—and I to despair of
success—when a door opened, and I beheld a
most terrific figure approaching the place of my
concealment.


Ors. Abelino, I suppose.

Cal. No—but probably one of his
aid-decamps, for he stalked towards me, and striking
me violently on the shoulder—Begone, old
villain, thundered he.—He actually' call'd me—me,
Calcagno, old villain.—Begone—carry this letter
to him who sent thee—and warn him, that those
who become spies upon our conduct may have
reason to repent it.—I war> on the point of saying,
\"Worthv Sir, I am of the same opinion."

Ors. How tedious !—what ensued ?


Cal. Farewell, said he;—and he accompanied
this adieu with a still stronger compliment over
my shoulders—and disappeared.

Ors. And is this all?


Cal. All!—and is it not enough—when men
of honour and spirit receive such salutations from  
  
  
  2
<!-- Leaf 57, Page: 43 -->
rascals-—it is rather difficult to endure them;—
but as he first thrashed me as it I had no more
feeling than a post, and afterwards made a
postman of me,—I have laboured in my vocation,
and brought you the letter as fast as I could
hobble.—It was a perilous crisis—and once
delivered from this cursed plot I swear—

Ors. (interrupting.) You were not born for
glorious enterprizes.—

Cal. It may be so—but I was born to live, and
to live long I hope; the trade we follow may
make glorious men—but they promise to be short
lived ones.


Ors. (opening the letter.) Let me see—(he reads)
* Count Orsano, you doubt my fidelity, your
\"suspicions are unjust; for a bribe, Michaeli
* would have betrayed us. He merited the death
\"I gave him.—When you receive this, Walstein
\"will be no more, we shall meet at the Council."  
  
  
  " Abelino."


Ors. Walstein ! will he dare attempt it ?

Cal. That he will—he will dare any thing. All
is fish that comes to his net.


Ors. If he keep his word we shall have no
formidable adversary to fear; for I have thought
of means to prevent Vivaldi from opposing us.

Cal. I too was ruminating upon that.

Ors. Well, what was the result?


Cal. No matter—I never declare my plans till
they are perfectly digested.

Ors. Pshaw! I have spread reports of Rosara's
forcible removal, that will probably alarm his love,
and induce- him to attempt obtaining entrance to
the palace. There I shall be prepared for him.
Soon shall he expiate, by an ignominious death,
<!-- Leaf 58, Page: 44 -->
that arrogant presumption, which dared to
counteract the love and the ambition of Orsano.


Alf. (without, to the Doge.) Yet hear me, my
lord.


0>s. We are interrupted, (looking out) go to the
port, and execute the important commission already
confided to you.

Cal. I was on the point of bringing it to your
recollection—but you are so sharp—you are like
an almanac-maker, you know every thing before it
happens. [Exit.

Enter the Doge and Alfieri. (Speaking with
warmth).


Alf. (to the Doge.) No, no, my lord, you must
not refuse my request.

Doge. The majority of the senate oppose it.

Aif. What—condemn unheard—oh never let
our laws become the scoff of after times—drag
guilty treason into public view—expose it to the
glare of open day, but still let justice, with
impartial aim, pursue each motive to its primal source—
thus truth shall stamp it with eternal obloquy, or
cleanse the victim from its foul reproach.

Ors. May I inquire the cause of so much
warmth ?


Alf I would intreat the Doge that Walstein be
admitted to justify himself before the council.


Doge. To this request I cannot but oppose the
positive opinion of the senate.

Ors. It appears imprudent to consent.

Alf. Sir, I had foreseen your opposition.

Ors. (to Alfieri.) What motive induces you so
warmly to defend a man, who ought to be
indifferent to you ?
<!-- Leaf 59, Page: 45 -->

Alf. The same motive that induced me to defend
the Count Vivaldi from your rancour.

Ors. (confused.) How?—but Vivaldi was your
friend, this man is a stranger.

Alf. Some men dazzled by the glare of wealth
or power will become champions of the guilty, if
so supported; others, inspired by justice and
compassion, declare themselves the advocates of
unprotected merit whenever they behold it injured or
oppress'd, and such, I trust, the difference between
the Count Orsano and myself.


Doge. Calm this asperity.

Ors. (aside.) I must dissemble—why use to me
such severity of language—to prove my high
esteem and firm" reliance on your principles, I no
longer oppose Walstein's admission to plead his
cause before the council—let him be heard, (aside)
If Abelino keeps his word, you are welcome to
this acquiescence.

Alf. (aside.) This sudden change of sentiment
conceals some hidden treachery—all is not right.

Doge, (to Orsano.) This moderation gives me
pleasure, in every period, in all forms of
government, 'tis unanimity alone secures a nation's
greatness, but especially in times like these, when every
thing most dear and sacred to the subject and the
citizen, is menaced with destruction—all talents

should unite, all jealousies should cease, and then,
my friends, you truly will become the pillars of
your country. Patriotic senators, I accede to your
request, and will sign the order for its completion.
(The Doge approaches the table to write.)

Ors. (aside) He dies ere he can defend himself.

Ros. (enters with wildness, and much agitated
during the scene, saying as she comes in) Walstein
impeached! the senate refuse to hear his
<!-- Leaf 60, Page: 46 -->
justification!—(then enter) ah, senators, and you, my
father, pause ere you commit a crime so fatal,
chosen to be guardians of the laws, justice and
mercy should be your only counsellors—oh
beware! for dreadful is the retribution that awaits
you—should envy of his martial glory or private
malice devote the innocent to death—tho' here
redress may be denied, from their neglected tombs
an awful voice will rise and call for vengeance
from that tribunal to which the virtuous never can
appeal in vain.


Doge. Rosara, what means this frantic rage ?

Ros. For you, Count Orsano, to be virtuous is
a sufficient passport to your hatred—but will you
so far despise all semblance of integrity as to
become at once his judge and his accuser?

Alf. (low to Rosara.) You know not what you
do, this excessive zeal will prove destructive.

Ros. You hope that none will undertake his
cause—vain man, to me belongs this glorious task,
and 1 shall prove how well I can fulfil my duty.

Ors. Her duty !

Doge. She raves, she knows not what she utters.

Ros. Inspired by the sacred energies of virtuous
love, I will present myself before the senate, and
proclaim his wrongs—eight years of suffering, his
past and present services—all, all will plead for
him, and even his calumniators shall shrink back
appall'd, and own the loyalty of my most injured
husband.  
  
  
  Doge. Husband!
Alf. What have you said?
Ros. Why should I fear to own it? Walstein or

Vivaldi equally endangered, why should I hesitate
to assert the injustice of the senate, who doomed
to death the same Vivaldi to whom as Walstein—
<!-- Leaf 61, Page: 47 -->
  
  Doge. Walstein—Vivaldi I
Ors. Vivaldi—Walstein !  
  
  
  An Officer enters.


My lord, a rumour goes that our general
Walstein is assasinated.  
  
  
  [Rosara screams, and sinks into the arms of

Alfieri.


Doge. Walstein assassinated ! can it be true ?
this demands inquiry—follow me.
[Exit all but Rosara and Alfieri.

(As Orsano follows the Doge he says) dauntless
Abelino then thy work is done—my vengeance is
complete.

Alf. (to Rosara) Madam, in the name of
heaven, restrain this wild emotion, the report is false,
spread by your husband to insure his projects.  
  
  
  Vivaldi enters hastily.


Fiv. Where is Rosara ?—is it true that—?
(seeing Rosara) My wife !—my love—look up,
Rosara ! Rosara !  
  
  
  Alf. Fly, fly Vivaldi, or you are lost for ever.
Fiv, And leave her thus—never ! never !


Ros. (recovering.) My husband art thou safe?
alas ! I tremble to see thee here—why, why didst
thou venture ?


Fiv. Your father means to force thee hence,
and canst thou ask why thy Vivaldi comes to save
thee?


Alf. That report was a mere artifice of that
arch fiend the Count Orsano.


Fiv. Oh, too successful artifice—the fear of
losing thee has drawn me from my secret retreat,
<!-- Leaf 62, Page: 48 -->
when it was necessary, as Walstein, I should be
known no more.


Alf. Perhaps, 'tis not too late, you yet are
unobserved.


Ros. Fly, dear Vivaldi, your death is decreed—
fly, and rely on my unceasing love to save or
perish with thee.


Fiv. Do you desire it ? Must I leave you ?

Ros. I entreat—I implore it. (offering tc embrace.}

Fiv. We shall meet again. Farewell, farewell.
(they embrace.) The guardian God of innocence
protect thee.

[At the instant Vivaldi is departing, Orsano
en
ters with soldiers and arrests him.]  
  
  
  Ors. You are our prisoner.
Ros. Oh, heav'n !  
  
  
  The Doge enters.


Doge, (meeting Vivaldi.) Walstein here ? rash
man, what strange temerity has led thee hither ?

Ftv. What should the guiltless fear?

Doge. Ambitious man, thy projects are
understood.


Alf. (to Orsano.) You, sir, who but a few
moments since united your voice to mine, and vowed
he should be heard—will you suffer—

Pro. Silence ! good Alfieri—you but intreat in
vain—the scale of justice can never preponderate
on the side of mercy when the beam is entrusted
to a villain's hand.  
  
  
  Ors. Honour forbids.


Viv. (with pointed irony.) Honour, prostituted
term! Honour and Orsano cannot bear
connection.
<!-- Leaf 63, Page: 49 -->

()rs. Rail on—it is the privilege of guilt
detected.


Doge. Lead him to a dungeon—

Alf. If that's effected, he is lost for ever.
[Exit ALFIERIi

Ros. Oh, my father, revoke this cruel order.

Fiv. Despair not, dearest Rosara.

Ros. When every thing combines to aid the
Fury of thy enemies, who can protect thee ?

Fiv. Heaven !—


Ros. And Rosara, (rushing to him.) who would
resign her life with transport could it save thine.

Doge, (to the guards.) Separate them, drag him
hence !  
  
  
  
[They force them asunder as she clings to him.
Ros. I will not leave him—barbarous men !restore me my husband, (to Orsano.) Oh! you
triumph !

Fiv. Not yet—take courage—Providence may
still protect lis. [Exit, guarded.

Ros. Away; hold off your hands !

Doge. Heed not her idle rage—-convey her to
her apartment—

Ros. Hear me, father—and you, (to the guards!)
respect the daughter of the Doge, (they retire.)
{To the Doge, solemnly.) You have torn me from
my husband, but death alone shall force me from
this spot.

Doge. This is madness.

Ros. Love, connubial love has fixed my station
here.—If his judges have the common feelings of
humanity, if they have hearts my grief will soften
them. Yes, I shall save my husband !

Ors. Your hope is vain.

Ros. I had forgot that you were of the number.
E
<!-- Leaf 64, Page: 50 -->

Ors. Listen, madam, to the dictates of your
better reason.


Ros. Approach me not, monster; (drawing a
dagger.) I have already said.—Death only, or the
pardon of my husband shall remove me hence.
[Trumpets sound.

Doge. Remain then;—this is no time for
contest, the senators are here. [Exit Doge.
[Trumpets again.

Ros. (being left alone.) Power supreme, (whose
dispensations, tho' inscrutable, are always just,)
Oh, grant me to support this awful trial;
proportion my strength to the difficulties that surround
me and oppress my feeble frame.—Thus having
perform'd my duty, with cheerfulness and
resignation I bend myself to thv decree.

[Folding doors open to the grand council chamber.

Doge, Alberti, and Senators, Conspirators, &c.
discovered.


Doge. Senators—Vivaldi is at Venice—Vivaldi
the traitor—he whom you have so justly punished
for his former crimes; he again dares to pass our
gates, and polute our ears with murmurs of
complaint—with consummate art, with unparalleled
address he has assumed the character of Walstein,
and in this disguise has joined the members of a
dangerous conspiracy, the existence of which is
fully proved. I have caused him to be arrested,
his fate the senate must determine.


Ors. Vivaldi merits death both from his treasons
past and this his present crime.  
  
  
  Several Sen. Doubtless, doubtless.  
  
  
  Several Sen. Death ! Death 1
<!-- Leaf 65, Page: 51 -->

Ros. My lords, there is another victim, more
guilty still than even your devoted, poor Vivaldi.

Alb. Another victim ?  
  
  
  Ros. Yes—Rosara !


Doge. You !

Ros. Yes I, Rosara—great Doge pronounce my
sentence—the doom will be receiv'd with transport
that issues from a father's lips.

Doge. Take her hence—grief has o'ercome her
reason !


Ros. The senate must not be partially severe;
Vivaldi is my husband, the noble ambition by which
he is actuated, his views and the virtuous source
from which they flow, equally animate the heart
of his Rosara—of his return to Venice I am the
cause and motive. If to be great and good is
tortured into crime amongst you, then is my hero
guilty—/am guilty too! and the same
punishment, the same malignant vengeance should fall
on husband and on wife.


Doge. Senators, beseech you, regard not the
ravings of a frantic woman who would hazard life
itself to save a worthless traitor, (shouts are heard.)
What means that tumult ? (trumpets and shouts.)
Enquire the cause. ["Messenger goes out.

Ros. (shouts repeated.) Your judgment, lords!
Pronounce upon Vivaldi and Rosara.
[Shouts continued.


Mess, (returns to the Doge.) Those shouts, my
lord, proclaim'd Vivaldi's liberty.—

Doge. His liberty !

Mess. Just as he reached the prison gates a
troop of armed men rushed suddenly upon the
guard, and inflamed and encouraged by a member
of the senate, forc'd them to disperse, and bore
Vivaldi off in triumph.—  
  
  
  e 2
<!-- Leaf 66, Page: 52 -->

Ros. Then, (falling on her knees exultingly.)
heaven is just and succours the oppress'd.

Doge. Who is this senator who thus defies the
laws ?  
  
  
  Enter Alfieki.


Alf. (with dignity.) Alfieri !

All. (with surprise.) Alfieri! ! !

Alf. I grant my conduct calls for explanation :
from early youth the father of Vivaldi was my
valued friend; I knew him to be clear of the foul
charges brought against him, yet did he sink
unaided—his son partook of my affection, he is
threaten'd with his father's fate. I know him to
be honourable—his heart is pure, his conduct
irreproachable.—It was my duty to preserve a dear
and noble friend, and by protecting him, to save
my country from the guilt of sacrificing the man
who fought her battles—brought conquest to your
gates—and plac'd your state of Venice on that
high eminence where now she stands.—

Ros. Generous Alfieri!—virtue has one
mediator still left among you.


Doge. Rash and mistaken man^—your age should
teach you something better than this specious
sophistry—think you the senate will allow this
outrage to remain unpunished ?

Ors. Order that Alfieri be detain'd.  
  
  
  
[A noise without, Vivaldi as Abelino enters

with his troops.]
Viv. Ay ! let none retire^—all must remain,
Do^e. Abelino !

[I hey all testify those emotions of joy or fear,

adapted to the feelings oj'the different parties.
Viv. (to the Doge.) You see I am faithful to.
<!-- Leaf 67, Page: 53 -->
my word; I wrote to you that all precautions
would be vain, and that I could assail you when
you would least expect it;—here then in your
very senate am I come to execute my threat.

Doge. Villain ! thy callous mind defies the
vengeance of insulted justice, because it is delayed—
but it will at length overtake thee.

Fiv. (looking to the conspirators significantly) It
will overtake others first.


Ors. (aside.) Now let my proud victims tremble,
my triumph is secure !  
  
  
  Some Senators of the party rise.—


Sen. Let us not be tamely butchered, but meet
our fate like men.


Fiv. (drawing out a pistol.)—The first that moves
will meet his death, (turning towards the
conspirators.) Count Orsano, my noble associate, is all
prepared ?


Ors. Yes.—proceed.—

Fiv. (to the Doge.) You see I am in sufficient
force, small is the resistance I have to fear.—


Doge. Can this be possible?

Fiv. Attend in silence.—Orsano and you,
illustrious champions in a glorious project, declare
yourselves, without reserve, point out your destined
victims.—Abelino is ready in support of the just
cause.


Car. The present Doge shall be deposed—and
here, we appoint Orsano to succeed him.

Cons. Orsano ! Orsano shall be Doge.

Alb. Orsano! never shall a traitor fill the
senatorial chair!—


Ors. Force then shall decide—[to the conspira^
tors] follow my example, [draws his poignard.] &c.

Doge, [withfortitude.] Strike! Traitors, strike!
<!-- Leaf 68, Page: 54 -->
  
  [Rozara and Alfieri interpose.]


Viv. Hold !—one moment's pause;—[placing
himself between the parties] [to the Doge] you
now perceive, great Sir, the fate of your far famed
Republic, and your own depends on me—on me—
the out-law'd son of Rapine—the proscribed
Abelino!—[turning to the conspirators!] My brave
associates, your courage meets my expectation;—
you shall now receive the recompence you merit.
[turning tozvards the Doge's party.] The soldiers
—to your duty—you already know your charge—
your victims, whose crimes not even signal
punishment can expiate—who, but now exulting in
imaginary safety, long to drench their daggers in the
blood of innocence. 1 say—Seize on—these
Traitors, [turning quickly round to the conspirators,
whom the soldiers bursting from all sides of the
Senate, instantly arrest.] While I in form more
dreadful than the stings of conscience, or the
murderer's remorse, to the tortured fancy of such
miscreants, present their deadly foe — the wrong'd
Vivaldi! [throwing off his disguise.]

Sen. and Cons. Vivaldi!


Ros. My husband!—[falling on his neck.]

J iv. Count Orsano—upon you depends the
restoration of my father's fame;—your dark
designs procured his banishment.—Confess that you
have wronged him—your fate is in my power—do
justice to his memory—if thy own life be worth
preserving —


Ors. 1 will not be interrogated"! conduct me
instantly to death!—[Exit guarded, Cons. &c.

Doge. Generous Vivaldi!—can the Republic
e'er repay the vast, vast debt of gratitude she
owes thee? and can thy noble nature in oblivion
<!-- Leaf 69, Page: 55 -->
bury the rank injustice, which malignant envy
heaped upon thee ?

Fiv. Friend to Alfieri—son to you—husband
to Rosara—PRESERFER OF MY
COUNTRY,—can earthly happiness be more complete ?

Doge. Then let a father's blessing crown thy
love; and all thy future joys be shared amidst the
applauding honours of thy grateful country.

Fiv. Propitious moment! — when the heart
prompts the hand to perform such acts as honour
dictates, and as virtue sanctions, the voice of
approbation, is the cordial balm that cheers the
mind, and leads it on, to deeds of future Glory.—

  EPILOGUE.  
  
  
  By Mr. CHERRY.

THE conflict o'er, and safe the best of metiy
My tears I've dry'd, and am—myself again;—>
But why our Author shou'd my shoulders goad.
With the strong pressure of his tragic load,
Extracting start and vhine—and mournful oh !
And all the essence of theatric woe,

From me—" unused to the melting" sigh,
Who Hie to laugh — but seldom wish to cry;—*
Whate'er his drift—here let the matter pause,
In laugh or cry I seek but your applause.


My patriot spouse—tho* alien to the laws,
Long brav'd all dangers in his country's cause;
To gain a wife, and save a falling state,
He smil'd at peril, and he courted fate:
Few wives, like me, wou'd pity his disgraces,
Or plead a husband's cause, who wore—three faces !
And yet I've heard—but doubt the censure true,
Most modern husbands fam'd—for wearing tuo:
Well, be it so;—our sex need never roam,

When sweet variety is found at home !—

Shou'd my good man, Vivaldi, shew his airs,

\"My dear," says I, " I'll qualify those cares;
*' Brave Walstein loves me—" (the creature sighs—)
\"But Abelino is the youth I prize?'

Then ladies, thus, pray serve your tuo-facd fellows,
No husband, of himself, can e'er be jealous:
This, the grand secret 'twixt the man and wife,
Good-humour, vary'd, is the balm of life.—  
  
  
  [Ha, ha, ha !—O lud !—O lud!]

Men are but fools with all their boasted sense!
With solemn nonsense all their plans commence;
Confed'rate schemes in holes and corners brewing—*
But women only can a nation ruin!—«  
  
  
  S
<!-- Leaf 71, Page: 57 -->
What say you ladies to a little treason ?—
A plot I mean—to bring the men to reason :
If once conspiring, with digested plan,
We'd soon reduce the boasted pride of man;—
But hold;—before we openly rebel—

'Tis just the nature of our claims to tell :
Imprimis:—Pin-money:—must be double
Routs and Gala's—ne'er consider'd trouble.

Our tradesmen's bills:—why—let our husband's pay;
Or let 'em wait—and call another day :

Our hours—tho' late—nay, chang'd from day to night,
From night to day—admit no question'd right:

And if on these plain terms we can't agree,
A sep'rate maintenance must set us free;
But if it changes still from bad to worse,
These claims alone are subjects for divorce.


What say you ladies, will you join with me,
And make one glorious effort to be free?—
Success is certain—and, when ours the day,
We'll shew with what meek mercy we can sw3y;
Nor add the pride of conquest to our charms,
But to the vanquish'd wretches yield—our arms !—
Men can be grateful;—but if not—why then,
A gen'rat muster—and Rebel again !—  
  
  
  
Bless me !—quite forgot the Poet of the night;—
I left him truly in a piteous plight:—  
  
  
  He bade me say—(but I'm a giddy creature)  
  
  
  I knew not what—it rests wit/iYO vs. good-nature
His three-fae'd out-law—tho' a bold endeavour,
He trusts—will not out-law him from your favour;
Already strongly did I plead his cause, ~J
But lest your judgment on his fate shou'd parse, >
O let his sentence be—your kind applause. J

  POSTSCRIPT TO THE PUBLIC

ABELINO le grand Bandit, ou l'Homme a
trois Visages, was put into my hands by Mr,
Bingley, jun. N° 20, Carburton-street, who
travelling through Brunswick, saw it performed at
the Duke's Theatre, and thought an English
translation might be made effective.—I mention
this circumstance, because I hear other
productions from this subject are in being, and I choose
to mention the source from whence this drama
springs. In adapting the translation to our stage,
I was careful not to alter the original form, the
chief merit of the piece consisting in a rapid
succession of interesting situations, some of which I
think have been heightened.—The foreign dress
was quaint and spiritless, and declamation (the
favourite of the French stage) abounded; the latter
I have considerably expunged, the former I
endeavoured to adorn.


The execution does not satisfy me, but
hereafter I may propose something better.
<!-- Leaf 73, Page: 59 -->

To Mr. Cherry, who (after it had been read in
the Green Room) offered some valuable alterations,
I am considerably indebted, and I embrace most
willingly this opportunity of publicly
acknowledging the readiness of his talent.—1 am further
obliged to him for the Epilogue.


It is impossible to vary the mode of thanking
the Ladies and Gentlemen of the Theatre for their
aid, and yet the omission of it from one of the
Corps Dramatique would be obnoxious to
misconstruction, and I really feel most truly obliged
by every assistance afforded me.


Mrs. H. Johnston distinguished herself
considerably—and both hands and eyes have declared

it.


Benefit Plays (new ones I mean) are held in
such weak estimation, that even the diurnal prints
scarcely deign to remark upon them, and the
Public, who expect nothing on such occasions,
because they conceive the Managers would not
refuse any thing that had pretension to attention,
are uninterested—hence arises a disadvantage of
serious moment, for not to be spoken of, is of all
slights the worst.—A modern successful writer is
said to have exclaim'd in the outset of his
literary life—" I must starve on sullen
indifference, abuse me, abuse me or my fortune is
marrd,•" he was right, for discussion of every
kind tends to develope the truth, and though  
  
  
  1
<!-- Leaf 74, Page: 60 -->
great defects may be discovered, still a gem, if it
exist, is not buried in neglect.


The audiences who were at the representation
of the Venetian Outlaw are my witnesses of the
unanimous applause it met with.  
  
  
  The Critics will decide on its claims.

♦ *» A few bours before this play was ready for
publication, another translation impudently asserting to be the one
\"now performing at Drury-Lane Theatre," has been shewn
to me. The Publie have been cautioned in advertisements to
avoid this fraud, and I hold it unworthy to give any celebrity
to impertinence by dwelling on the subject. However, that
my work may not be bastardiz'd on a cross breed, I merely
submit the following note from Mr. Graham :  
  
  
  " Dear Sik,


\"Do not permit the insinuations thrown out in the
advertisement to another translation of " Abelino le grand Bandit,
Sic." to have any weight; recollect that similar circumstances
have occurred before. I am ready to declare on oath that you
never saw, or could have the slightest knowledge of, the piece
published by James Powell.
